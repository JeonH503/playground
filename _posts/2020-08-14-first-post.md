마침네 여기 첫번째 게시글이 있습니다. `_posts` 폴더에 게시글을 작성하면 자동으로 빌드됩니다!

약간의 예시 파일 또한 적어보겠습니다.

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

​```python
def print_hi(name):
  print("hello", name)
print_hi('Tom')
​```
